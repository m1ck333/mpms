namespace AlgreenMES.API.Middleware;

/// <summary>
/// Sets a minimum baseline of security-related HTTP response headers on every
/// API response. These are cheap defense-in-depth — none replace TLS, auth,
/// or input validation; they shrink the attack surface against the common
/// browser-side classes (clickjacking, MIME-sniffing, referer leakage, etc.).
///
/// Notes per header:
/// - <c>X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</c>: stops browsers second-guessing
///   the Content-Type. Protects against polyglot uploads being interpreted
///   as scripts.
/// - <c>X-Frame-Options: DENY</c>: refuses to be embedded in any iframe.
///   The MES dashboards/tablets are never legitimately framed by a third
///   party, so DENY is the safe default. (Same intent as
///   <c>frame-ancestors 'none'</c> below; both kept for browser coverage.)
/// - <c>Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin</c>: keeps full
///   URLs (which include order numbers, user IDs) from leaking via Referer
///   when a link is clicked out to an external site.
/// - <c>Strict-Transport-Security</c>: enforces HTTPS for 1 year including
///   subdomains. Only sent for non-localhost so dev over plain HTTP keeps
///   working.
/// - <c>Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'</c>: the modern
///   replacement for X-Frame-Options. We deliberately keep the CSP narrow
///   to frame-ancestors only — the API doesn't serve HTML, and a stricter
///   default-src would risk blocking legitimate API responses or the
///   OpenAPI dev page. The FE bundles serve their own CSP at the nginx
///   layer if/when we add one.
/// - <c>X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none</c>: legacy Flash/PDF
///   reader fence — almost-free, no downside.
///
/// Adds nothing the BE-side fetch behaviour relies on; only sets response
/// headers, never reads them. Place after <c>UseHttpsRedirection</c> and
/// before <c>UseAuthentication</c> so 401/403 responses also carry them.
